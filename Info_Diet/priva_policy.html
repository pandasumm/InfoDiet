<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1. What does the MyTrackingChoices extension do? What is its goal/purpose?</h2>
<p><a href="https://myrealonlinechoices.inrialpes.fr/">MyTrackingChoices&copy;</a> is developed to provide users the capability of deciding which Web-page categories are most-sensitive to them and then, define different levels of privacy accordingly.
This is an attempt to not harm the Internet economy because, as opposed to current AdBlockers, we provide more granular options to the user.

Users can continue receiving profile-based targeted ads on categories of Web-pages they're ok to be tracked.
<!--In the same way, location, contextual and generic ads can be delivered to them on categories of Web-pages where they choose to just reset the HTTP cookies.-->
At the same time, users can avoid tracking on Web-pages that are most sensitive to them.
Also, users are provided with the option of blocking third-party trackers' network connections per Web-page basis and therefore, users can penalize Web-page with intrusive ads.
This last option would encorage publishers not to include intrusive ads on their Web-pages.
</p>


<h2>2. What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>We only collect some pseudo-annonymous information.
    For each user:<br>
    1. We collect the categories of Web-pages where a user wants to block trackers.<br>
    2. We collect the hashes of the visited Web-pages along with the categories the Web-page they fall into as per our categorizer.
    If available, we also collect the trackers present on the visited Web-pages and urls of all "third-party" embeded iFrames to study the impact on ad economy.
    </p>
<p>
We stress that we don't gather any information that could be used to link the user back to the data, e.g., cookies, IP address or any other user-identifier.
Futhermore, we will not try to re-identify participants.
To correlate the user data across various uploads, we generate a pseudo-identifier per user when the extension is installed.
</p>


<h2>3. What do we use your information for?</h2>
<p>

The extension is developed by Inria as a research project.
The collected data will allow us to investigate user preferences regarding online tracking and also, measure the impact on Internet economy if such a tool is in wide-spread use.
<!--The data is used to better understand how people are tracked and profiled on the Internet by commercial entities.-->
</p>


<h2>4. How do we protect your information?</h2>
<p>
All information that we collect are anonymous.
We don't not collect cookies, IP addresses or any identifiers.
</p>
<p>
The data is sent through HTTPS to our server and stored in an encrypted disk.
The data will be stored for the duration of the research project, and at most 18 months.
</p>


<h2>5. Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
<p>
We don't share the information that we collect to any outside parties.
</p>


<h2>6. How to opt-out from uploading my data for research purposes?</h2>
<p>
You can opt-out by clicking <a href="optout_ok.html" id="optout">here</a>.
<br><br>
However, if you later decide again to continue participating sending your data for our research, please, <a href="optout_cancel.html" id="optout_cancel">click here</a>.
